Introducing Pawsitive Care Veterinary Clinic! 
We are dedicated to providing compassionate, expert care to ensure the health and happiness of your pets.
With our pawsitive approach, we prioritize their well-being every step of the way.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pawsitive Care Veterinary Clinic is a console application I will be developing for the final project. This application is to be developed for pet owners who value and prioritize their pets health. 

This clinic does include a database with five tables.

In this application, users will be able to view their personal and pet information, as well as edit their personal information.
Users cannot edit pet information as that is the organization's responsibility. There is a menu option to register. 
Users will need to be registered with the clinic to schedule an appointment. The last menu option lets users exit the program. 
There are 6 total menu options available to the user.
